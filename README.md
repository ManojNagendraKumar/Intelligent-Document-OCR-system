# Intelligent-Document-OCR-system
This project is an Intelligent Document OCR system that leverages OpenCV, YOLO, and Tesseract to perform intelligent OCR on documents, detecting layout elements, extracting text, and retrieving metadata like titles and authors. It supports multi-page PDFs, converting them into images and processing each page for structured output.
